    I should've stayed at home
    'Cause right now I see all these people that love me
    But I still feel alone
    Can't help but check my phone
    I could've made you mine
    But no, it wasn't meant to be and see, I wasn't made for you
    And you weren't made for me
    Though it seemed so easy
    And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy
    I wanna be the one that makes your day
    The one you think about as you lie awake
    I can't wait to be your number one
    I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
    But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry
    But won't you wait?
    You know it's too late
    I'm on my own shit now
    Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
    I feel great
    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
    You need to be yourself
    Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool
    That makes your heart melt
    Who knows what you truly felt?
    You're still my favorite girl
    You better trust me when I tell you
    There ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world
    In this damn world
    You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
    You're gonna wanna be my best friend
    I said that
    You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
    You're gonna wanna be my best friend, best friend
    You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
    You're gonna wanna be my best friend
    Best friend
    You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby
    You're gonna wanna be my best friend
    I say that I'm happy
    I say that I'm happy
    But no, no, no, no
    No, no, no
    Oh, I still wanna be your favorite boy
    I wanna be the one that makes your day
    The one you think about as you lie awake
    And I can't wait to be your number, your number one
    I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
    But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry
    I still wanna be your favorite boy
    I wanna be the one
    I might just be the one
